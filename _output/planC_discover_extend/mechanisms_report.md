# Mechanisms Report

## Funding Segmentation
Low cross-tenor cointegration and divergent regime half-lives imply that dealers and hedge funds manage tenor silos rather than unified books.
## Liquidity Provision
Short auction-induced deviations with fast decay suggest primary dealers absorb supply shocks quickly when balance-sheet is abundant; longer CPI-driven deviations point to constrained macro hedge demand.
## Dealer vs Hedge Fund Roles
Evidence of persistent post-break regimes aligns with hedge fund leverage cyclesâ€”dealers enforce mean reversion locally, while leverage constraints prolong dislocations.
## Support for Segmented Arbitrage
Combined diagnostics support the segmented funding market hypothesis: high AR(1) persistence but rapid event decay indicates limited capacity to exploit cross-tenor spreads, consistent with funding fragmentation narratives.
