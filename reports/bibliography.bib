  abstract  = "ABSTRACTTextbook arbitrage in financial markets requires no
               capital and entails no risk. In reality, almost all arbitrage
               requires capital, and is typically risky. Moreover, professional
               arbitrage is conducted by a relatively small number of highly
               specialized investors using other people's capital. Such
               professional arbitrage has a number of interesting implications
               for security pricing, including the possibility that arbitrage
               becomes ineffective in extreme circumstances, when prices
               diverge far from fundamental values. The model also suggests
               where anomalies in financial markets are likely to appear, and
               why arbitrage fails to eliminate them.",
