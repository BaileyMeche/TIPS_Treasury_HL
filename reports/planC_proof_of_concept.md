# Plan C Proof-of-Concept

This proof-of-concept run executes the Plan C pipeline end-to-end and produces artefacts that can be shared with stakeholders.

*Data mode:* Sample synthetic inputs

## Summary statistics
- **Start Date:** 2023-01-01
- **End Date:** 2023-01-31
- **Observations:** 31
- **Mean Basis:** -12.3110
- **Median Basis:** -12.3103
- **Std Basis:** 0.2063
- **Min Basis:** -12.6859
- **Max Basis:** -11.9694

## Notes

The synthetic nominal leg and the TIPS leg are constructed using the Plan C modules. The resulting basis illustrates how the toolkit can surface mispricing dynamics even when only public proxies are available.
This proof-of-concept configuration focuses on reproducible CSV outputs and omits plot generation to keep the artefact footprint lightweight.
